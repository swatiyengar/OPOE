# OPOE

 Analysis of US FDA's Off-Patent, Off-Exclusivity semi-annual product list to answer the following questions:
- Who are the producers of the products on the FDA's OP-OE list (v. 06-21)?
- When were drugs on the OP-OE list (v. 06-21) first approved?
- Based on the first OP-OE list in 2017, how many new manufacturers have entered the market in the US?

To answer these questions, I connect to OpenFDA's Drug Endpoint, and may eventually combine the dataset with GoodRx's US Pricing Data, WHO's ATC/DDD index, and the Indian National Medicines Registry.
